### Introduction to Plotting in Python

Welcome to the world of data visualization, 
where hidden patterns and trends in data are uncovered through visual storytelling. 

### Course Aims

Learn how to create engaging and insightful statistical visualizations with Python's **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**
library, a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation of attractive and useful 
statistical visualizations.
With less code and a focus on aesthetics, Seaborn helps you create stunning graphics that effectively communicate your data.

Seaborn builds on the flexibility of **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**, 
simplifying the process while maintaining the ability to fine-tune plots for clarity and aesthetics.

Throughout the lesson, key Matplotlib functions will also be introduced, 
as they are essential for customizing and enhancing Seaborn-generated plots.

Letâ€™s embark on this journey together and unlock the stories waiting to be told within your data!
