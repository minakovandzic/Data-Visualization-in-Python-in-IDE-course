### Lesson Overview: Creating a Bar Chart of Video Game Genres by Platform

The focus of this lesson will be on learning how to visualize data effectively
by creating a bar chart that displays the number of games across four specific gaming platforms:
**PS4**, **XOne**, **PC**, and **WiiU**, categorized by their genres.

This visualization will help in understanding the distribution of video games in different genres on these platforms.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Introduction to the Dataset**
   - The lesson will start with a discussion about the dataset that will be used. This dataset includes columns for game titles, platforms, genres, and other relevant information, serving as the foundation for analysis and visualization.
   - Example of the dataset structure:
     
      | Game Title   | Platform | Genre      |
      |--------------|----------|------------|
      | *FIFA 16*    |  PS4     | Sports     |
      | *Mario Kart* | WiiU     | Racing     |
      | *The Sims 4* |  PC      | Simulation |
      | *Minecraft*  |  XOne    | Misc       |

   
2. **Loading the Data**
   - The first task will involve writing a function to load the CSV file. This step will allow easy manipulation and analysis of the data.


3. **Exploring the Data**
   - Before plotting, exploring the dataset will be important to understand its structure and contents. This step ensures clarity about how to use the data effectively.
   - Checking for unique platforms and genres in the dataset will assist in the subsequent visualization.

4. **Creating the Bar Plot**
   - Once a good understanding of the data is established, the next step will involve creating the bar plot.
   - The setup of the plot will include configuring the figure size and style, and creating a count plot that illustrates the number of games per platform by genre.

5. **Customizing the Plot**
   - After generating the initial plot, adding titles and labels will enhance clarity and presentation.
   - This customization will include setting the title of the chart, plot theme, as well as labels for the x-axis and y-axis, making the chart more informative.

6. **Displaying the Final Plot**
   - Finally, the completed bar plot will be displayed. Observing how the code translates into a visual representation of the data will illustrate the number of games per platform, segmented by genre.

### Conclusion

By the end of this lesson, there will be a solid understanding of how to visualize categorical data using bar charts. Experience in data loading, exploration, and plotting will be gained through the use of Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The first step is ready to be taken: loading the dataset!
